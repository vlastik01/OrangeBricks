# Originally it was a Purplebricks Developer Test


The existing web application supports two types of customer. Sellers are able to upload information about a property and list the property for sale. Buyers can search for a property and make an offer. When an offer has been placed on a property the seller should be able to accept or reject the offer.

# For a kick of it I am rewriting this demo app in F# to show how great the F# is ..

### Objective 1 - Extend an existing feature (and rewrite in F#) 

We need you to extend the offer functionality of the web application so that when a seller accepts an offer the buyer that placed the offer can see that their offer has been accepted.

**User Story:** *As a buyer I want to see when my offer has been accepted so that I can proceed with the property purchase.*

### Objective 2 – Add a new feature ( and rewrite it in F#) 

We need you to add the ability for a buyer to book a viewing. It’s unlikely a customer would want to make an offer on a property without booking a viewing.

**User Story:** *As a buyer I want to book a viewing appointment at a property so that I can determine whether I would like to make an offer.* 
Implementation detail: the creating offers can be used as a template, only one has to check whether a certain time span has been taken . 

### Objective 3 - replace Razor with Elm (or Websharper) 

### Objective 4 - whenever it makes sense, replace javascript with Fable

### Objective 5 - when done, create a parallel project in Websharper and write an article about comparing both approaches.

### Objective 6 - will see if I can replace MS SQL server with neo4j. 

### Objective 999 - Review the existing code

Write a short review of the existing sample codebase. Let us know what you think is good or bad about it. Feel free to fix any problems and commit these changes to the solution.
